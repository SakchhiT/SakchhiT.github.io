				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I did not realize how many different strategies there were for Dark Patterns. 
							I think the most shocking one for me is Bait and Switch, especially the Microsoft 
							example where when you click the "X" button on an installment pop-up, instead of closing it, 
							it initiats the download. That's not even just a UI tatic, that's just lying! The ones 
							I fall victim to the most often would be Forced Continuity, Hidden Costs, and Roach Motel 
							(as I still get email from so many websties I can't unsubscribe from). </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was the "Big Picture Effects of Dark Patterns" because it 
							summarized how all these tatics can influence society. I found it shocking 
							how mileading titles of news articles can be, I didn't even consider to to be 
							a part of UI, it's just straight up lies. Especially on news sites like ABC News 
							which are credicted to be "official" and unbiased. I don't think there should be ephasis 
							on advertisement and "shock factor" when it comes to news articles since it can be extremely 
							misleading and harmful. I always wondered why my parents got such outrageous news on 
							their Facebook pages before understanding that Facebook caters there news (even false ones) 
							ads to its users based on their observed opinions.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave. " </p>
