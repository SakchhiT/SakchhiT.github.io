							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article made me aware that many designers have to consider purpose and accessibility when implementing their designs. It's not just about how a color looks, but what purpose is it serving? And how accessible is it to your audience? Here is a quick recap of topics I learned 
								1. Be mindful of how much your text is contrasting, 2. Don't only rely on color for relaying important information, 3. Add textures to labels of different coloers so it's easier for people with color-blindedness, 5. Set a standardized palette so it's easier to keep track of information   </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> "Color accessibility requires a little up-front work when selecting your product’s color palette, but ensuring your colors are accessible will pay dividends down the road." I didn't know there were guidelines for color accessibility. I will definitly check out the Web Content Accessibility guidelines for future reference! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude." I just made me laugh lol. </p>
