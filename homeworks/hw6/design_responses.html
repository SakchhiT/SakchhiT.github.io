					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about all the different components that come into play for animation such as duration and speed of animation based on the size of the screen what you're animation. I also learned about how using techniques like easing and motion blur plays into the affects of animation. I found it really interesting how physics concepts come into play as well like when acceleration and friction matters. I hadn't realized that since animation is art it derives from real world sequences.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article were the visuals that demonstrated each concepts mentioned because it helped me understand what a good versus a bad example looks like. Especially the animations that coincide with curves. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
