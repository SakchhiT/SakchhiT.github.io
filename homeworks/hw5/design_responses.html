                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I enjoyed learning about how color varies based on people's perceptions, emotions, and culture. I also enjoyed learning a little about color theory and the dimensions of color like hue, saturation, and value. I really liked looking through the desings on the article as well. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part was probably just viewing the animations in the desin and seeing the different types of websites animation can be incorporated into from fashion, to ride sharing services. Animation is such a large term that incorporates both 3D, and 2D as well as graphics or live photos. However I think when animation is added to too many elements I can become redundant. I have experience using websites where the animation becomes annoying. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked "AI Powered Assistant by Lubo≈° Volkov" because of the graphics and the subtle (not obnoxious) animation. It felt professional and minimal. I belive it avheived it's goal wonderfully because the minimal graphic choice feels very clean and futuristic and is on theme for an AI powered assistant. (Similar to siri).   </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 7 I actually read a different article becaues the article linked didn't have any text, only images would load for me so I reac another article about color from the same author but for the rest of the questions I answered based on the interfaces shown in the articles.  </p>
