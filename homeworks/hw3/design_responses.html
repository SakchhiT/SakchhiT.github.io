						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the structure of this article and how they broke down font styling into 3 main factors; 
								readability, legibility, and purpose. I also didn't realize that many typographers look at well 
								knows ratios to determine font size, I thought it was mainly preferene and eyeballed. Lastly, I 
								find it interesting how many attributes there are to typography such as weight, size, color, font, 
								even location of where you place your text. 
								</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was exploring the links provided. For example CreativeBloq and 
								Awwwards have lists of free fonts, some of which I've saved for future use. These are all great 
								resources which I know will come in handy when creating my own website later. WhattheFont is also great 
								because I sometimes come across text but can never find which font it is.  
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users."" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
