        <div> Hi my name is Sakchhi! I am from Cupertino, CA but I was born
                  and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal. In my free time I love to crochet,
                  run, watch video essays, and I've recently started doing pilates. 
                  On a typical day you can find me studying with my friends at a cafe, 
                  cooking, or speed walking through campus with my headphones on.

            <li> What is something you learned from this article? 
                <div>From the observations in the apps shown, I realized how so many features were there with intention. 
                Especially in the Airbnb listing where the search bar gave an example search instead of the default "Search Bar", or blank bar.
                It's definity a enticing strategy to promote their app and toursim. </div>

            <li> What was your favorite part of the article? </li>
                <div>My favorite part was how interactive the read was and the gifs they included for different apps. I definity observed things I would not have normally.</div>
