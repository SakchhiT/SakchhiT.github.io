							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the general scope of the Gestalt theory which is that the human brain will always find a way to simplify complex designs by seeing structures and patters within them. 
								This can be divided into 6 principles: Proxomity, common fate, continuity, similarity, closure, common region, and symmetry. Proximity refers to how close two elements are, common fate are for elements that get grouped 
							together because they point to or are moving in the same direction. Continuity refers to how our eyes will always follow the smoothest lines, and similarity is used to group elements into the same catagory becaues of their color, shape, size, etc..
							Closure refers to how out minds will fill in gaps of a design that aren't explicitly there (for examle the WWF panda logo <- even though it's not a full panda, the shapes are so similar that our brain will fill in the gaps). And much more... </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> (not that I couldn't read the original article becuase it's members-only access so I read this one instead: https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/gestalt-principles-how-to-apply-them-to-a-mobile-app-design-f36dbaeb5372)
								My favorite part of this article were the example of each principle shown on example mobile app design. For examle how the login, favorites, and shopping cart icons are placed all in a common region (or similarity) to show they are all features of the website and will take you to your specific "inventory." 
								Another example I saw was continuity. For example when displaying image cards that are horizontally scrollable, the card at the end of the screen is cut off or there is a bar below it to show theres more to scroll.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Using design rules is vital to construct a good design and ultimately a good experience for the user â€” you may have a great idea and just kill it with bad design decisions." </p>
						</li>
